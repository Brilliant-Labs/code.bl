# 1_SETTING PASSWORDS

__Passwords__ are super important in cybersecurity, and we're here to help you with that! They're the main way users can be sure they're who they say they are! Let's dive into some key points about passwords in cybersecurity together!
A strong password is usually long and complex, which makes it much harder for anyone to guess or crack them.
Most common passwords attack are __Brute Force, Phising, Dictionary Attack, Credential Stuffing__.

Oh, yes! We‚Äôve all been there, right? The __Cyberville__ School has been hacked, and that‚Äôs why you have to solve __Mission 1__. It can happen to anyone, and we totally get it if you're feeling a little overwhelmed right now. But don't you worry! There are ways you can protect yourself and our __Cyberville__ School for future attacks.

Let's learn together about some of the most common attacks on our passwords. Once we've done that, we'll solve the first mission, "Weird Lights - School Under Attack!"

## Activity
__*Let's start!*__   

We've made it really easy for you to recreate the awesome environment from Mission 1 while learning about cybersecurity. All you have to do is:

__1.__ [Download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1u48lccLm7I4rxf287-CPFnYVhJqHE8gb/view?usp=drive_link), print and cover the b.board for Mission 1.

__2.__ Students and teachers, we just wanted to remind you that it's important to choose a password to set up the __Cyberville__ network. It should be eight characters long, so that it is easy for you to remember, but difficult for intruders to guess.
teachers will setup the password on M5Core2 Module, students will do it on their code for b.Board.


## üßë‚Äçüè´ __Teachers:__

There are three differents ways to setup passwords on M5Core2 to start with the activity __Mission 1__.

Options to setup __Passwords__:

__No Password__ Don't press any buttons on the initializing screen. [Video Here](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGJhwOPNfA/C7i4j-8NuAyaVB4WW4ZQLg/watch?utm_content=DAGJhwOPNfA&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=editor). 

__Default Password__ In this case the Default Password is __BL_Cybr1__. Just wanted to let you know that you must press the first button on the initializing screen to set the default password. [Video Here](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGJh3x2cWc/WLy_dI8ckApegcX8nVluYw/watch?utm_content=DAGJh3x2cWc&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=editor). 

__Custom Password__ We highly recommend this option to involve the students, just press middle button on M5Core2 on the initializing screen, and enter the agreed 8 characters of the password agreed between the student and the teacher, for example __BL_cyb24__, at the end please press the middle button again for three seconds to set it.

Students should do the steps made in 1_Connectig for __Networking__ in the previos activity, but adding the __Password__ defined in class.

Just a quick note to ask that you please __make sure that b.Board is connected__. Thanks so much!
