# PASSWORDS 

Welcome to Mission 1! In this mission, you'll learn some basic concepts and methods used in cybersecurity. These include passwords, brute force, dictionary, rainbow table, shoulder surfing, and more. In __"Mission 1: Weird Lights,"__ you'll have to solve a dare and get the right sequence to protect the school from a new cyber attack. Good luck!

## Activity Description
### __Mission 1__ Weird Lights.  School Under Cyber Attack!

![Mission_1](https://github.com/Brilliant-Labs/code.bl/blob/code_alpha/packaged/docs/static/mb/projects/bboard-tutorials-cyberville/Passwords/School_Under_Attack.gif?raw=true "Mission 1")

Cyberville has a traditional K to 12 school with a student population of 350 students.  The building is standard and uses some components of the Internet of Things (IoT) like heat control and automatic lighting to work during normal school hours and to be closed at night.  These lights can also be controlled remotely by a supervisor working at the government building.  To save money, the school also controls heat and conditioning air with a remote-controlled thermostat from the government building (5).

Recently, some reports have been sent to the supervisor about heat and light-related problems.  For example, one day the temperature in some classrooms went up without notice and was so uncomfortable that students and teachers had to leave the classroom.  Some events included lights flashing in the gymnasium and intermittent blinking in the school cafeteria.  Also, the number of phishing emails and spamming mail has increased.  Last week, Internet access was interrupted for a day.  Students and teachers couldn’t go on the Web for that period.

I just wanted to let you know that there is a proper way to turn on the devices affected by this situation to protect and save the school from the cyber attack. I know it can be tricky, but I'm sure you can find it!

The five affected devices are listed as Heat Center, Air Conditioning, Lamps Cafe, Lamps Gym, and Internet, which have a corresponding BLiXel number in the b.board. Provide the Cyberville community with the right sequence using your b.Board and get success in this mission, save the school! Thank you so much for your help!

In addition, you have to perform a __Penetration Test__ in the school‘s web infrastructure to see potential problems and to find potential malware that could have been installed.  If you find anything, you will have to identify the source of the problem, rectify the situation and prevent this situation from appearing again.  You will have to produce a Cybersecurity Assessment Report that identifies the problems observed, your solutions and your recommendations to fix these issues. Have Fun!!!
