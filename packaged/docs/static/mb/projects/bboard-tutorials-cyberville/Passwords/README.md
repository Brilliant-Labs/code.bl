# PASSWORDS 

Welcome to __Mission 1!__ In this mission, you'll learn some basic concepts and methods used in cybersecurity. These include passwords, brute force, dictionary, rainbow table, shoulder surfing, and more. In __"Mission 1: Weird Lights,"__ you'll have to solve a dare and get the right sequence to protect the school from a new cyber attack. Good luck!

## Activity Description
### __Mission 1__ Weird Lights.  School Under Cyber Attack!

![Mission_1](https://github.com/Brilliant-Labs/code.bl/blob/code_alpha/packaged/docs/static/mb/projects/bboard-tutorials-cyberville/Passwords/School_Under_Attack.gif?raw=true "Mission 1")

__Cyberville__ has a traditional K to 12 school with a student population of 350 students.  The building is standard and uses some components of the Internet of Things (IoT) like heat control and automatic lighting to work during normal school hours and to be closed at night.  These lights can also be controlled remotely by a supervisor working at the government building.  To save money, the school also controls heat and conditioning air with a remote-controlled thermostat from the government building (5).

Recently, some reports have been sent to the supervisor about heat and light-related problems.  For example, one day the temperature in some classrooms went up without notice and was so uncomfortable that students and teachers had to leave the classroom.  Some events included lights flashing in the gymnasium and intermittent blinking in the school cafeteria.  Also, the number of phishing emails and spamming mail has increased.  Last week, Internet access was interrupted for a day.  Students and teachers couldnâ€™t go on the Web for that period.

I just wanted to let you know that there is a proper way -*a sequence*- to turn on the devices affected by this situation to protect and save the school from the cyber attack. I know it can be tricky, but I'm sure you can find it!

In summary, the five affected devices are listed as __Heat Center, Air Conditioning, Lamps Cafe, Lamps Gym, and Internet__, which have a corresponding BLiXel number in the b.board. Provide the __Cyberville__ community with the right sequence using your b.Board and get success in this mission, save the school! Thank you so much for your help!

Ready to level up your cybersecurity skills? as a complementary activity Let's dive into the world of penetration testing! This is a great way to identify potential problems and find any malware that might have been installed on the school's web infrastructure. Once you find something, you get to be the detective and figure out where it came from, how to fix it, and how to make sure it doesn't happen again. The best part? You get to create a Cybersecurity Assessment Report, where you'll document all the problems you find, your solutions, and your recommendations to fix them. It's a great way to show off your skills and help keep the school's digital space safe and secure! __*Have fun!*__
