# PENETRATION TEST

Hi there! Have you ever wondered what a __penetration test__ is? It's a way of testing the security of a computer system, network, or web application by simulating a cyber attack. The goal is to identify and exploit vulnerabilities to determine whether someone could gain unauthorized access or cause other problems.
Penetration testing is an important part of keeping your organization in this case our __Cyberville__ School safe from cyber threats. It helps us make sure that our systems are strong and can handle any potential attacks.
