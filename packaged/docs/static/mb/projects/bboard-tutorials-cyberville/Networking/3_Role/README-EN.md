# 3_Roles. 

To complete this activity you must acquire a role in Cyberville so that you can protect it from Cyber Attacks.

## Activity:
### Take a role in The Cyberville

*Let's start!*

__1.__ Fill out your __Cyberville ID__ Card with names, MAC addresses ðŸ†”, and IP addresses ðŸ“®.

__2.__ Acquire an identity by choosing a role within __Cyberville__.

__3.__ Develop a code where your icon is always displayed on the micro:bit screen to indicate that you are connected to Wi-Fi in __Cyberville__.

__4.__ Program the Microbit to play sound or  start melody (You can find it in music blocks) if you are not connected in __Cyberville__.

Remember, your role in __Cyberville__ could be one of those important entities.

It should look like this for someone who chooses __WATER__, and it is connected.

Once you've successfully linked each b.Board in the classroom to __Cyberville__ and assigned it a role, it's time for the fun part! Your teacher will simulate a __Cyber Attack__ by disabling the M5 module, which is the WiFi provider for __Cyberville__. This will disconnect all the devices in __Cyberville__, creating a situation of chaos and general fall in the __Cyberville__ network!
