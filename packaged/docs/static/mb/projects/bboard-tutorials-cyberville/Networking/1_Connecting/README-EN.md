# 1_CONNECTING

  It's time to connect to the WiFi __Cyberville__. __Cyberville__ is a cool representation of a futuristicville developed by the awesome folks at Brilliant Labs. In this Cyberville, all clients or b.Boards are connected to the WiFi Cyberville network. The WiFi service on __Cyberville__ is provided by the M5Core2 module, which will create the WiFi Access Point 📳 called __Cyberville #?__. Let´s connect us to belong to __Cyberville!__.  
## Activity Description
The __*🧑‍🎓 students*__ should be able to connect to the Cyberville Wifi Access Point created by the 🧑‍🏫 __*teacher*__.

*Let's start!*
## __🧑‍🏫 Teachers:__
In order to establish the requisite access point 📳, it is essential to utilize the M5Core2 module, as this will facilitate the necessary configuration. The __Networking_BL_EN__ activity, which is within the M5Core2 module, should be selected and loaded. 

##### ~avatar
It is essential that students be provided with the name and number of the access point that has been created.
##### ~

It may be beneficial to share your MAC address 🆔 and IP address 📮 generated by the M5Core2 module with students, as this will provide them with a visual representation of the format. 
####  Access Point Name - Cyberville Number
Note that __we will not use a password__ for this activity, as the Cyberville number will change each time you restart the M5Core2.

## __🧑‍🎓 Students:__
__1.__ Create a new project using micro:bit V2, be sure that you are using a __b.Board V.1.4__, naming it Networking_A.

![Step1](https://github.com/Brilliant-Labs/code.bl/blob/code_alpha/packaged/docs/static/mb/projects/bboard-tutorials-cyberville/Networking/1_Connecting/Step1.png?raw=true "Step1")  

__2.__ Use the Connect to WiFi:( ) with Password:( ) block and plase it inside the On Start block.

__3.__ Make sure you use the exact WiFi name as it appears on the M5Core2. Ask the teacher 🧑‍🏫 for the correct information.

![Step2](https://github.com/Brilliant-Labs/code.bl/blob/code_alpha/packaged/docs/static/mb/projects/bboard-tutorials-cyberville/Networking/1_Connecting/Step2.png?raw=true "Step2")  

__4.__ Create a logic conditional block __if__ to know when you are conected. Use a smale face to display in the microbit.

__5.__ Create another block to disconnect from the network. You can use *On logo Pressed*.

![Step3](https://github.com/Brilliant-Labs/code.bl/blob/code_alpha/packaged/docs/static/mb/projects/bboard-tutorials-cyberville/Networking/1_Connecting/Step3.png?raw=true "Step3")

__6.__ Turn on the b.Board and establish communication between the PC, micro:bit and b.Board.

![Step4](https://github.com/Brilliant-Labs/code.bl/blob/code_alpha/packaged/docs/static/mb/projects/bboard-tutorials-cyberville/Networking/1_Connecting/Step4.png?raw=true "Step4")
  
__7.__ Download the code and check the connection and disconnection code with the M5Core2 module WiFi access point.

## __What to expect?__
If you get a ✅, you are connected to Access Point 📳.

Students 🧑‍🎓 will see smile face 😃 if they are connected.

or a sad face 🙁 if they are not.

![Disconnected](https://github.com/Brilliant-Labs/code.bl/blob/code_alpha/packaged/docs/static/mb/projects/bboard-tutorials-cyberville/Networking/1_Connecting/Disconnected.png?raw=true "Disconnected")

Upon pressing the Microbit logo, students will be disconnected from the system.   
In order to reconnect, it is necessary to either modify the code -be ingenius- or restart the b.Board.

## Code Example

You can download the code for this activity from `https://www.brilliantlabs.ca/documents/cybersec/Networking_A.hex` the file will be in Recent Download History, just drag and drop it into a new project.  

Or use this code example is to connect the b.Board to M5Core2 module Access Point 📳.

__*Please do not forget to set up the correct name for the access point. Mute the PC sound to listen the b.Board sound.*__

```blocks
input.onLogoEvent(TouchButtonEvent.Pressed, function () {
    Cybersec.Disconnect()
    basic.showIcon(IconNames.Sad)
})
Cybersec.WifiConnect("Cyberville #?", "")
if (Cybersec.WiFi_Connected()) {
    basic.showIcon(IconNames.Happy)
}
```
