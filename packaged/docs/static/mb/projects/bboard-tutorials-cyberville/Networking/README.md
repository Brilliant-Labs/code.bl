# NETWORKING 

Hey there! We know that cybersecurity can be a pretty technical topic, but we're here to make it as easy as pie! Cybersecurity __NETWORKING__ is all about keeping your data and systems safe from prying eyes and malicious attacks. Computers that access, use, and share network resources are called clients. In Cyberville, we're going to use b.Boards instead of computers as clients to join the Cyberville network and develop different activities to learn about cybersecurity. This is going to be really fun! As you connect and identify with a role, you'll learn about networking concepts like access points, hostnames, "pinging", MAC addresses, IP addresses, and more. Don't worry if it seems a bit confusing at first! We're here to help! Welcome to the Cyberville, have fun and enjoy coding and learning!

# Activity Description
This activity aims to enhance understanding of how computer networks operate and the roles electronic devices play within a network. Teachers and students will collaboratively create their own WiFi network in the classroom, assuming roles in Cyberville, a futuristic city concept developed by Brilliant Labs for academic representation.

This activity uses the b.Boards as clients, and the M5Core2 microcontroller module as WiFi Access Point.

### 🧑‍🏫  __*Teachers*__
Teachers must select the __Networking__ activity on the M5Core2, and follow the steps according to the activity.

To select any activity within M5Core2, see this [**_Video_**](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGJhm69_Mk/JdN1bb74mN-bKiclzST5Ag/watch?utm_content=DAGJhm69_Mk&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=editor).

This is a basic spec sheet for the M5Core2:

### 🧑‍🎓 __*Students*__
Students get to create their very own Cyberville community! Here's how it works:   
  __1.__ Connect to b.Board to the Cyberville WiFi 📳.  
  __2.__ Find b.Board MAC 🆔, and IP 📮 Addresses.  
  __3.__ Take a role in Cyberville 👤.  
Return to the main page and begining the Cybercille Networking activities as listed:  __1_Connecting__, __2_MAC & IP Addresses__, __3_Roles__, __4_Pinging__.  
Have fun!
