# NETWORKING 

Hey there! We know that cybersecurity can be a pretty technical topic, but we're here to make it as easy as pie! Cybersecurity __NETWORKING__ is all about keeping your data and systems safe from prying eyes and malicious attacks. Computers that access, use, and share network resources are called clients. In __Cyberville__, we're going to use b.Boards instead of computers as clients to join the __Cyberville__ network and develop different activities to learn about cybersecurity. This is going to be really fun! As you connect and identify with a role, you'll learn about networking concepts like access points, hostnames, "pinging", MAC addresses 🆔, IP addresses 📮, and more. Don't worry if it seems a bit confusing at first! We're here to help! Welcome to the __Cyberville__, have fun and enjoy coding and learning!

# Activity Description
This activity aims to enhance understanding of how computer networks operate and the roles electronic devices play within a network. Teachers and students will collaboratively create their own WiFi network in the classroom, assuming roles in __Cyberville__, a futuristic city concept developed by Brilliant Labs for academic representation.

This activity uses the b.Boards as clients, and the M5Core2 microcontroller module as WiFi Access Point.

### 🧑‍🏫  __Teachers__
Teachers must select the __Networking__ activity on the M5Core2, and follow the steps according to the activity.

To select any activity within M5Core2, see this [**_Video_**](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGJhm69_Mk/JdN1bb74mN-bKiclzST5Ag/watch?utm_content=DAGJhm69_Mk&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=editor).

This is a basic spec sheet for the M5Core2:

### 🧑‍🎓 __Students__
Students 🧑‍🎓 get to create their very own __Cyberville__ community! Here's how it works:   
  __1.__ Connect to b.Board to the __Cyberville__ WiFi 📳.  
  __2.__ Find b.Board MAC 🆔, and IP 📮 Addresses.  
  __3.__ Take a role in __Cyberville__ 👤.  
Return to the main page and begining the __Cyberville__ Networking activities as listed:  __1_Connecting__, __2_MAC & IP Addresses__, __3_Roles__, __4_Pinging__.  
Have fun!
