# NETWORKING 

Hey there! We know that cybersecurity can be a pretty technical topic, but we're here to make it as easy as pie! Cybersecurity NETWORKING is all about keeping your data and systems safe from prying eyes and malicious attacks. Computers that access, use, and share network resources are called clients. In Cyberville, we're going to use b.Boards instead of computers as clients to join the Cyberville network and develop diferents activities to learn about cybersecurity. This is going to be really fun! As you connect and identify with a role, you'll learn about networking concepts like access points, hostnames, "do ping", MAC addresses, IP addresses, and more. Don't worry if it seems a bit confusing at first! We're here to help! Welcome to the Cyberville, have fun and enjoy coding and learning!

# Activity Description
This activity aims to enhance understanding of how computer networks operate and the roles electronic devices play within a network. Teachers and students will collaboratively create their own WiFi network in the classroom, assuming roles in Cyberville a futuristic city concept developed by Brilliant Labs for academic representation.

### __*Students*__
Students create the Cyberville community doing this steps:  
  __1.__ Connecting to the Cyberville WiFi.  
  __2.__ Find bBoard MAC and IP Address.  
  __3.__ Take a role in Cyberville.
