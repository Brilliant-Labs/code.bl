# Networking

Is a network is a large system consisting of many similar parts that are connected together to allow movement or communication between or along the parts, or between the parts and a control center.

## Description
This activity aims to enhance understanding of how computer networks operate and the roles electronic devices play within a network. Teachers and students will collaboratively create their own WiFi network in the classroom, assuming roles in Cyberville a futuristic city concept developed by Brilliant Labs for academic representation.
