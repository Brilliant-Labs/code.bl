# VALUABLE DATA 

Welcome to __Mission 2!__ In this mission, you'll learn some basic concepts and methods used in cybersecurity. These include Phising, Malware, Location AP, Scams and more. In __"Mission 2: Polluetd Water,"__ you'll have to solve a dare and get the right ratio to keep the water safe in Cyberville from a new cyber attack. Good luck!

## Activity Description
### __Mission 2__ Polluted Water.  Water Treatment Plant Under Cyber Attack!

Cyberville is a water treatment plant like other cities across the country.  Recently, citizens have complained about the taste of drinkable water.  Some days, the taste was different and other days, the water had a nauseating smell.  The addition of __Chlorine and Fluoride__ are done automatically and these chemical are important to keep the water safe.  The dosage is important as too much or not enough of these chemicals could be disastrous for the community.  Two remote-control machines are used to add small quantities of these chemicals after water tests are done every week.  The results are sent are placed in a database at City Hall and adjustments are made automatically if needed.

Your mission is to analyze and produce a Cybersecurity Assessment Report to help city officials prevent the wrong distribution of __Chlorine and Fluoride__ in Cybervilleâ€™s water plant.  You will have access to the setup of the chemical distributors about __Cholrine and Floride__ to get water safe. The important thing is to find some answers to the the following questions ; 
Is the website genuine?
Is the information you found reliable?
Is the information from a reputable source?
Could the source of the information pose a security risk (e.g., malware)?

To get the correct ratio of Chloride to Fluoride for the Cyberville Water Treatment Plant, please use the information on the Cyberville websites and send the right ratio through the b.Board.

In summary, there are 10 different levels for Chloride, displayed as blue on the Neopixel, and 10 levels for Fluoride, shown as green on the same Neopixel. Each level is represented by a BLixel. (Cybersecurity Kit #2 includes a Neopixel with 30 BLiXels.)

Ready to level up your cybersecurity skills? as a complementary activity Let's dive into the world of penetration testing! This is a great way to identify potential problems and find any malware that might have been installed on the water treatment plant's web infrastructure. Once you find something, you get to be the detective and figure out where it came from, how to fix it, and how to make sure it doesn't happen again. The best part? You get to create a Cybersecurity Assessment Report, where you'll document all the problems you find, your solutions, and your recommendations to fix them. It's a great way to show off your skills and help keep the water treatment plant's digital space safe and secure! Have fun!
