Welcome to __Mission 2!__ In this mission, you'll learn some basic concepts and methods used in cybersecurity, including phishing, malware, ransomware, encryption, location-based attacks, and much more. In "Mission 2: Polluted Water," you'll have to solve a challenge and __*determine the correct ratio*__ to keep the water safe in __Cyberville__ from a new cyber attack. Good luck!

## Activity Description
### __Mission 2__ Polluted Water
#### *Water Treatment Plant Under Cyber Attack!*

__Cyberville__ is a water treatment plant like other cities across the country.  Recently, citizens have complained about the taste of drinkable water.  Some days, the taste was different and other days, the water had a nauseating smell.  The addition of __ðŸ§ªChlorine__ and __ðŸ§ªFluoride__ are done automatically and these chemical are important to keep the water safe.  The dosage is important as too much or not enough of these chemicals could be disastrous for the community.  Two remote-control machines are used to add small quantities of these chemicals after water tests are done every week.  The results are sent are placed in a database at City Hall and adjustments are made automatically if needed.

Your mission is to analyze and produce a Cybersecurity Assessment Report to help city officials prevent the incorrect distribution of __ðŸ§ªChlorine__ and __ðŸ§ªFluoride__ in __Cyberville__'s water plant. You will have access to the __*Setup the ratio between the two*__ chemical distributors for __ðŸ§ªChlorine__ and __ðŸ§ªFluoride__ to ensure the water is safe. It's important to answer the following questions:

* Is the information you found reliable?
* Is the dosing machine working correctly, or is it affected by a virus?
* Could the source of the information pose a security risk (e.g., malware)?
* Does encryption help me protect myself?

To get the correct ratio of __ðŸ§ªChloride to ðŸ§ªFluoride__ for the __Cyberville__ Water Treatment Plant, please use the information on the __Cyberville__ websites and send the right ratio through the b.Board code configuration.

There are 10 different levels for __ðŸ§ªChlorine__, displayed as blue neopixels, and 10 levels for __ðŸ§ªFluoride__, shown as green, all on the same Neopixel Strip. Each level is represented by a neopixel. The __Ratio Chloride:Fluoride__ should be visualized according to the levels. The figure below represents 5 levels of __ðŸ§ªChlorine__ and 10 levels of __ðŸ§ªFluoride__. Cybersecurity Kit #2 includes a Neopixel Strip with 30 Neopixels.

It's a great way to show off your skills and help keep the water treatment plant's digital space safe and secure! __Have fun!__
