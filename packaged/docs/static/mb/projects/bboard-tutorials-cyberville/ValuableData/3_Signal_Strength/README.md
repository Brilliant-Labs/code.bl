# 3_SIGNAL STRENGTH

Hey there! We're sure you'll be really interested to know that the location of your Wi-Fi Access Point 📳 in your house is super important for cybersecurity!

In this activity, we'll have a little chat about Wi-Fi signal strength. The Received Signal Strength Indicator, or __RSSI__, is a handy little measurement that shows you how strong the signal is that you're receiving.  We've got some great news for you! Our b.Board has a radio module and a block to read the power generated by the Access Point M5Core2 📳. Just a little heads-up: __RSSI__ is indicated by a negative unit called dBm. The higher the number, the better the signal! But how is related to cybersecurity? Because of the Access Point 📳 in our house, we can be more or less vulnerable for our __*valuable data*__.

Let's see how that works, and don't forget to answer the last test!

We're so excited to share some of the amazing benefits of placing your access point in the perfect spot!

__1.__ Reduced signal leakage 🙉 When your access point is in the center of your home, the Wi-Fi signal is less likely to extend outside, keeping your private information safe and secure. This is great because it helps prevent people you don't know, like your neighbors or even people with bad intentions, from detecting and trying to access your network.

__2.__ We all want to keep our homes safe and secure, right? Well, one way to do that is by containing the signal within your home. This helps to limit opportunities for attackers 🙊 to exploit vulnerabilities, such as attempting to break into your Wi-Fi network using brute force attacks on the password.

__3.__ Another great benefit is that you can control access 🙈 to your home network. By centralizing the access point, you can decide which areas of your home have stronger Wi-Fi signals. This helps you strategically decide where devices connect and who has access. This is especially important when it comes to securing your IoT devices, which could be more vulnerable to attacks.

__4.__ Another great benefit of a centrally located access point 🐵 is that it makes it easier to monitor your entire network for any suspicious activity. This is because it can track connections across the whole area of coverage more effectively.

__5.__ Secure guest network management 🔧🐒 by placing your access point in a central spot, you can easily manage your guest networks with confidence. This way, your guests can stay connected within a controlled area of your home, while you relax knowing they won't access any sensitive parts of your internal network.

## Activity  

### 🧑‍🏫  __*Teachers*__
It is the responsibility of the teaching staff to provide students with an Access Point 📳 using the M5Core2 module for this activity. The Networking activity is the most appropriate choice as it requires only the creation of an Access Point 📳.
It is also necessary to share with the students the following information regarding __RSSI__ and signal strength.

To determine the strength of the signal in __Cyberville__, the teacher 🧑‍🏫 should walk out of the classroom or away from the b.boards.
Students 🧑‍🎓 will read the signal strength based on their code, and Teacher's location with the M5Core2.

### 🧑‍🎓 __*Students*__
__1.__ Connect to the WiFi access point M5Core2 📳. The teacher must provide the AP name and password. Use the *Connect to WiFi* block. Remember, it should looks like this (✅ on screen b.Board):
![Connected_gif](https://github.com/Brilliant-Labs/code.bl/blob/code_alpha/packaged/docs/static/mb/projects/bboard-tutorials-cyberville/Networking/1_Connecting/Connected_gif.gif?raw=true "Connected_gif")  

If you got a small __x__ (❎ on screen b.Board), you are __*NOT*__ connected.   
  
__2.__ Use a block *on button A pressed*, inside add a *show string ()* block 
  
__3.__ Find the *Get the signal Strength* block in Cybersecurity blocks, and use it replacing the *hello!* word in Show String block.

__4.__ Get the __RSSI__ level and check how strong is the signal according to the Access Point 📳 location, get your own conclusion about the better plase to get a strong signal.

__5.__ Let's say this is your house... Where will you place your Access Point 📳 to protect your __valuable data__?

## Code Example

You can download the code for this activity from `https://brilliantlabs.ca/documents/cybersec/RSSI.hex` the file will be in Recent Download History, just drag and drop it into a new project.  

Or use this code as example to get the __RSSI__ power.

Allways be sure that you are connected in the right __Cyberville__ network, before you try a new code.

```blocks
input.onButtonPressed(Button.A, function () {
    basic.showString(Cybersec.getSignalStrength())
})
Cybersec.WifiConnect("Cyberville #2", "")
```
