# 3_GET SECURE INFORMATION

Guess what! Our __Cyberville__ Water Treatment Plant is under a Cyber Attack!!, and the water was polluted because we got a erradical information about the right ratio between the __🧪Chloride__ and __🧪Floride__ proportions.

This activity is related to __Malware  🦠 __, and our source of information is privided by __The Black Hat Frend__.

## Activity
__Let's start!!!__

Run the exaple code to ensure the levels bar on our plant are working correctly. Then 
follow the next steps.  

## __🧑‍🏫 Teachers:__

For __Mission 2- Water Polluted__ Please follow the next steps that you will find on M5Core2 module:

__1.__ Load __Mission_2: Water Polluted__ into M5Core2. You can see this [__video__](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGJhm69_Mk/JdN1bb74mN-bKiclzST5Ag/watch?utm_content=DAGJhm69_Mk&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=editor) if you want to remember how to do it.

__2.__ Press the first button __GO!!!__, then select one frend hat that you want to use as a challenge for your students 🧑‍🎓. 

![M2](https://github.com/Brilliant-Labs/code.bl/blob/code_alpha/packaged/docs/static/mb/projects/bboard-tutorials-cyberville/ValuableData/2_Get_Reliable_Information/M2.png?raw=true "Mission 2")  

__3.__ Share the current __Access Point name__ created by the M5Core2 with the classroom and the password if it is the case. For example:  
        AP name  📳: __Cyberville #1__  
        Password 🔑: __BL_Cybr1__ *(if you are using default one)*

Remember that there are three differents ways to setup passwords on M5Core2 for Cyberville network. Agree with student which password are you going to use for this activity.

Options to setup __Passwords__:

__No Password__ Don't press any buttons on the initializing screen. [Video Here](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGJhwOPNfA/C7i4j-8NuAyaVB4WW4ZQLg/watch?utm_content=DAGJhwOPNfA&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=editor). 

__Default Password__ In this case the Default Password is __BL_Cybr1__. Just wanted to let you know that you must press the first button on the initializing screen to set the default password. [Video Here](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGJh3x2cWc/WLy_dI8ckApegcX8nVluYw/watch?utm_content=DAGJh3x2cWc&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=editor). 

__Custom Password__ We highly recommend this option to involve the students, just press middle button on M5Core2 on the initializing screen, and enter the agreed 8 characters of the password agreed between the student and the teacher, for example __BL_cyb24__, at the end please press the middle button again for three seconds to set it.

__4.__ The __🧑‍🏫 Teacher__ will choose the sources of information on the 📳 M5 module screen, which will display the M5 module for Mission 2 as __Red Hat for Phising__. The 🧑‍🎓 students can find information on the __Webpage__ generated by the 📳 Access Point with 📮 IP address is: 192.168.4.1.

, __Black Hat for Malware__, __White Hat for Ransomware__, or __Blue Hat for Encription__.

## __🧑‍🎓 Students:__

__1.__ Be sure that your __PC__ are connected to the __Cyberville__  📳 Access Point, according to the information agree with the teacher.

__2.__ Get some information in the web page provided by the Access Point 📳. Remember that you computer needs to be in the same __Cyberville__ network.  

__3.__ Use your Water Plant Calibration developed in the previous activity as base of your new code.  

__4.__ Modify the code to provide the correct ratio of __🧪 Chlorine__ and __🧪 Fluoride__ at the water treatment plant, and send the new ratio to the access point to save the __Cyberville__ water treatment plant!!.  See the sample code below. 

__5.__ Obtain some clues on the __Webpage__ to get your ratio answer and send it to the Access Point 📳 to know if you fail or success for this activity.

__It's really important to understand the challenges related to the use of blocks for the 'Level of Chloride' and 'Level of Fluoride.' This should be reflected in the bar levels displayed on the Neopixel strip, so we can all be on the same page!__

## Code Source for the challenge
We really think you'll enjoy these challenges! To make it even more fun, we suggest you download the files so you can run them according to your teacher's selection.

- __Black Hat:__  
`https://www.brilliantlabs.ca/documents/cybersec/M2-Water-Plant-Black-Hat.hex`  

## Code Example

You can download the code for this activity from `https://www.brilliantlabs.ca/documents/cybersec/M2-Water-Plant-Base-Code.hex` the file will be in Recent Download History, just drag and drop it into a new project.  

Or use this code base as example to test the right ratio and save the Water Treatment Plant!.

__*Please do not forget to set up the correct name for the access point in your PC, and go to 192.168.4.1*__

```blocks
input.onButtonPressed(Button.A, function () {
    for (let Count = 0; Count <= 9; Count++) {
        CL_Strip.setPixelColor(Count + (10 - Cybersec.indexcl(Index_CL.zero)), neopixel.colors(NeoPixelColors.Blue))
        FL_Strip.setPixelColor(Count + (-10 + Cybersec.indexfl(Index_FL.zero)), neopixel.colors(NeoPixelColors.Green))
    }
    Full_Strip.show()
})
let CL_Strip: neopixel.Strip = null
let FL_Strip: neopixel.Strip = null
let Full_Strip: neopixel.Strip = null
Full_Strip = neopixel.create(DigitalPin.P2, 30, NeoPixelMode.RGB)
FL_Strip = Full_Strip.range(0, 10)
CL_Strip = Full_Strip.range(20, 10)
