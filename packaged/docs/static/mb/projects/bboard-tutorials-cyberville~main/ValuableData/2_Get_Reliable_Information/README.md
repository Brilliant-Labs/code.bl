# 1_Get Reliable Information ... Under construction!

Guess what! Our Cyberville Water Treatment Plant is under a Cyber Attack!!, and the water was polluted because we got a erradical information about the right ratio between the Chloride and Floride proportions.

As a Cyberville's citizen you need to know that __🧪 Chlorine__ is commonly used as a disinfectant in water treatment to kill bacteria and other pathogens. The concentration of __🧪 Chlorine__ typically ranges from 0.2 to 4 milligrams per liter (mg/L) in treated drinking water.

__🧪 Fluoride__ is often added to drinking water to prevent tooth decay. The optimal concentration of __🧪 Fluoride__ in drinking water is usually around 0.7 to 1.2 mg/L, although this can vary depending on local regulations and recommendations.

The ratio of __🧪 Chlorine__ to __🧪 Fluoride__ would then depend on the specific concentrations used in the treatment process, and it's not necessarily a fixed ratio. In some cases, there might not even be a direct correlation between the two as they serve different purposes in water treatment.

The ratio of __🧪Chlorine__ to __🧪Fluoride__ in treated water can vary depending on several factors including the specific requirements of the water treatment facility, local regulations, and the source water quality.

Students and teachers, we just wanted to remind you that it's important to choose a true and reliable source of information on Cyberville network. The web sites provided for this activity are not real, but student should be choose the best and reliable information to obtain the right ratio according to the information, Not all the information is reliable and you can fail in the try!! Be careful with the information that you select. Have fun!!

To develop this activity follow the next steps. 

## __🧑‍🏫 Teachers:__

The __🧑‍🏫 Teacher__ will choose between four diferent proportions on the M5Core2 screen, which will display the M5Core2 for Mission 2 as A, B, C, or D. This ratio will be secret to the 🧑‍🎓 students, but they can find information reliable or fake on the web site provided by the Access Point!

Remember that there are three differents ways to setup passwords on M5Core2 for Cyberville network. Agree with student which password are you going to use for this activity. 

- [__No Password__](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGJhwOPNfA/C7i4j-8NuAyaVB4WW4ZQLg/watch?utm_content=DAGJhwOPNfA&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=editor). Just a friendly reminder: don't press any buttons! Thanks!

- [__Default Password__](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGJh3x2cWc/WLy_dI8ckApegcX8nVluYw/watch?utm_content=DAGJh3x2cWc&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=editor). In this case the Default Password is __BL_Cybr1__. Just wanted to let you know that you must press the first button to set the default password. 

- [__Custom Password__](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGJhzixXtc/zuFnnSe0t3ZZR298o1uEjg/watch?utm_content=DAGJhzixXtc&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=editor). We highly recommend this option to involve the students, just press middle button on M5Core2, and enter the agreed 8 characters of the password agreed between the student and the teacher, for example __BL_cyb24__, at the end please press the middle button again for three seconds to set it. That is all!


## __🧑‍🎓 Students:__

1. Be sure that you are connected to the Cyberville  📳 Access Point, according to the infornmation agree with the teacher.
If you get a ✅, you are connected.

2. Get some information in the web page privided by the  📳 Access Point. remember that you computer needs to be in the same Cyberville network  which it IP address is 192.168.4.1.
3. Use your Water Plant Calibration developed in the previous activity as base of your new code.
4. Modify the code to provied the right ratio for __🧪 Chlorine__ and __🧪 Fluoride__ on the water treatment plant.
5. Obtain some clues on the webpage to get your ratio answer and send it to the  📳 Access Point to know if you fail or success for this activity.
