# Do Ping Tutorial for Blocks

## Let´s start

Let's do a quick __*Ping*__ to the Access Point 📳, the M5Core2 Module. It has a default IP address 📮 of __192.168.4.1__, which is great for getting started!

In your particular case, let's make sure everyone knows who you are, what your role is, and your MAC 🆔 and IP 📮 address. Show them your Cyberville ID card from the previous activities. Here is an example:

## Step 1

### Connect to Cyberville WiFi Network 

Place a ``||CyberSecurity:Connect to WiFi||`` block into __on start__ block to stablish conection with the __Access Point__ 📳 M5Core2.

```blocks
    Cybersec.WifiConnect("Cyberville #?", "");
```

## Step 2
Place a ``||input:on button pressed||`` block to run code when button **A** is pressed.

```blocks
input.onButtonPressed(Button.A, () => { 
});
```

## Step 3
Add ``||Cybersecurity:Do PING to IP||`` block to display if IP address __192.168.4.1__ is currently connected in the __Cyberville__ network.

```blocks
input.onButtonPressed(Button.A, function() {
    Cybersec.PingbBfrend("192.168.4.1");
});
```

## Step 4

If you have a __b.Board__, just connect it to USB and click "|Download|" to transfer your code. Then, press button **A** on your microbit-b.Board. You'll hear a _hello play song_, which is really cool, when the command __ping__ is executed, you'll also see a smile face 😃 if the IP 192.168.4.1 is connected in the __Cyberville__ network. If you see an ❎ on your Microbit screen with a sad play song, don't worry it means that your friend is not in the network!
Check your code and have fun!

## Step 6

Nice! Now go and check if your friends are connected in the __Cyberville__ network!
